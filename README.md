## Algorithm Challenge

Algorithm challenges are effective because there are more than one way to solve them. This opens the possibility for decisions to be made and the calculus of those decisions. When solving an algorithm problem, we should challenge ourselves to look at the problem definition from multiple perspectives, then weigh the benefits and demerits of various approaches. With enough practice, we might even glimpse a universal truth: there’s no “perfect” solution.

### About Jasmine

Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code. It does not depend on any other JavaScript frameworks. It does not require a DOM. And it has a clean, obvious syntax so that you can easily write tests.
